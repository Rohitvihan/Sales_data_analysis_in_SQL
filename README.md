## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

**SQL:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

**Queries:**
```sql
-- Total records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

-- Unique customers
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;

-- Unique categories
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- Null value check
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
  sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
  gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
  quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

-- Remove null records
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
  sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
  gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
  quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```
